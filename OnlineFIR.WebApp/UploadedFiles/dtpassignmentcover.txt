Reasons to use the colour combinations.

1.Yellow and Gray combination in magazine layout.

I have used this combination taking into consideration the layout of the "Wisden" magazine cover which is the inspiration for my design. Also, the combination of yellow and gray has been quite popular among designers and is being used extensively by designers all over the world.


2.Blue and White combination in the music app layout.

I have used this combination because it is a very simple but classic colour combination,it is simple but defines and enhances the content of the designs a lot. It is used nowadays in many apps due its "Clean and Sleek" look.Blue and white is an appealing combination because it is a very calm and peaceful palette that looks natural to most people. In design it creates a feeling of elegance and simplicity that is unparalleled.
